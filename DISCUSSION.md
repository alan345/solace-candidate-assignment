# Next Steps

Hereâ€™s what we should focus on implementing next:

- **Debounced Search:** Add debounce functionality to the search on the frontend to reduce database queries.
- **Specialties Search:** Enable search functionality in the `specialties` field, which is stored as JSON, using Drizzle.
- **Pagination Enhancements:**
  - Fetch the total number of pages from the backend.
  - Make pagination URL-driven for better state management and shareability.
- **Font Integration:** Add the **Mollie Glaston** font on the frontend to align with the design.
- **Frontend Caching:** Implement caching on the frontend to minimize database load.
- **Shared Types:** Share TypeScript types between the frontend and backend to reduce errors.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure the site is fully responsive and mobile-friendly.
- **Testing:** Add comprehensive tests to improve reliability and maintainability.
